# Manual Tester - Project

In this repository, I'll be testing an e-commerce website, specifically a demo website provided by [Sauce Laps](https://saucelabs.com/). The [demo e-commerce](https://www.saucedemo.com/) site is specifically designed for testing purposes.


## Steps Performed

- **Test Plan** - determining the test object, schedule, and tools used.
- **Test Case Design** - creating scenarios/tests based on the analysis.
- **Test Environment Preparation** - ensuring all components are complete before testing.
- **Test Execution** - running the test cases.
- **Reporting** - reporting each test run.

## Conclusion
After conducting the testing, I further developed my skills in analyzing and identifying bugs thoroughly, and I also learned how to classify bugs based on their functional severity. Thus, the testing process significantly improved my skills. I hope this project will help you learn more about software testing.
